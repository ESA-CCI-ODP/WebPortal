###The Zoom Control

- Clicking the +/- segments of the control cause the map to zoom in (+) and out (-)
- Clicking the globe between the two other controls causes the map to zoom to full (world) extent

If you click the globe accidentally, use the history control to go back to your previous zoom level
rather than repeatedly clicking the + control. This will save both your time, and your bandwidth.
